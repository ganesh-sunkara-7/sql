    "Organization:  Data is structured in a way that makes it easy to find and use.\n",
    "Management:    The DBMS controls access, security, and integrity of the data.\n",
    "Efficiency:    Databases support rapid search, retrieval, modification, and reporting of data.\n",
    "Scalability:   They can handle very large volumes of data and many users at once.\n",
